                <span>SEO specialist & Manager Assistant, from September 2021 to April 2022</span>
                <br>
                <p>I met the founder of a London-based SEO agency Alfamedio Ltd on his business trip to Belarus. He was looking for people to join his team as he was going to launch several new webistes covering different aspects of search engine optimisation.</p>
                <p>As a manager assistant I took charge of the routine work like preparing documents, contacting editors and freelancers, and recruiting specialists of all kinds for different SEO projects.</p>
                <p>My role as an SEO specialist included managing websites of the company, preparing and updating their content, creating unique and relevant images for blog posts and social media and publishing them. A big part of my working time was spent looking for the opportunities to build high-quility backlinks to the company's website.</p>

                <span>Demand Planner & Management Trainee, from May 2019 to July 2021</span>
                <br>
                <p>I was a 'newly baked' graduate from the state linguistic university with an honours degree in my hands and a passion to discover the business world in my eyes.</p>
                <p>I started my working journey at one of the biggest brands - Coca-Cola in the position of Management Trainee. This implied me learning duties of a wide range: I began as a Cooler Manager Assistant, then move to the Reporting team, and finally, in a year I became a Demand Planner at the Commercial Department.</p>
                <p>I excelled at managing reports, analysing tendencies, and presenting them to the team. I worked with top-notch experts in business analysis and sales and, thanks to my project as a Management Trainee, I learned a lot about cross-functional processes and innovational technologies.</p>
